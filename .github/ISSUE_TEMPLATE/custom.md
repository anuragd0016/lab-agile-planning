Understanding User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Epics
What is a User Story?
A user story represents a piece of business value the team can deliver within a "done" increment.
A good user story answers who the request is for, what they need, and why they need it, providing business value.
Unlike traditional requirements, user stories focus on the value delivered.
Parts of a Good User Story
Story Description:

Uses the format: As a [role], I need [functionality], so that [business value].
This clearly explains who the user is, what they need, and why it benefits them.
Assumptions and Details:

Include any assumptions or hints that might help the developer.
Examples: Specific technologies to use, dependencies on other functionalities, etc.
Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done):

Describes the conditions that must be met for the story to be complete.
Uses Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then) to clearly define the expected behavior:
Given sets up the scenario.
When indicates the action taken.
Then specifies the result.
The INVEST Acronym
To ensure a good user story, it should be INVEST:

Independent: Ideally, stories should be independent, so they can be prioritized easily.
Negotiable: The story's content can be adjusted, allowing flexibility.
Valuable: The story must deliver business value.
Estimable: The team must be able to estimate the effort required.
Small: Stories should be small enough to fit into a sprint.
Testable: Each story must have clear acceptance criteria that make it testable.
What is an Epic?
Epics are big ideas or user stories that are too large to fit within a single sprint.
Epics are broken down into smaller user stories that can be completed individually.
Use an Epic when:
A user story is too large to complete in one sprint.
You need to organize larger ideas into manageable pieces.
